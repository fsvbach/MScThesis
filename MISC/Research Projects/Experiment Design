1. Experiment design
Towards the end of the Probabilistic ML class we covered the question: Where to evaluate an unknown distribution, in order to gain the most knowledge, rather than obtaining the best result. This reminded me of the Game "Master Mind" where the player has to guess n=4 colors (from a set of k=8 colors) in correct order and gets certain feedback for each trial. Here, the feedback is an unordered set from {A,B,None}^n, where A: "correct color at correct position" and B: "correct color but wrong position".
I've implemented the setting with an Entropy approach. The algorithm maximizes the expected information it gets from each trial. Already here arose questions whether there exists cases in which this "greedy" behavior is significantly inefficient. However my main issue was the scalability of the approach. In the "General Master Mind" the input space is exponential in the number of possible colors k and length of the sequence n. Sampling from the distribution is not feasible, since at some point only few sequences have positive probability. I tried some strategies to exploit the structure of the feedback with little success. However there might exist smarter ways than entropy to approach this game. I would be curious to read about and implement them.
