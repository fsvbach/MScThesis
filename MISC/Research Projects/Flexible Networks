2. Flexible Networks
Algorithms similar to AlphaGo can solve fixed games like TicTacToe easily. However, as far as I understand them, if we increase the field size from 3x3 to 4x4 we have to train the network completely new. To me this is an unsatisfactory property of the approach. A human would easily abstract the solution for (n+1)x(n+1) TicTacToe from the solution of the nxn version. Moreover, if the field is not bounded at all (inf x inf), the input of the network needs to be flexible. Rather than just a fix n^2-number-input representing the field, now we need some increasing set of coordinates representing the moves as input for the neural network, which it might not digest as easily. I would find it interesting to develop an algorithm that achieves this task, namely a network that "solves" an unbounded N-dimensional K-in-a-row. Whether this is possible at all, I don't know. But I'd be happy to spend half a year thinking about it.
