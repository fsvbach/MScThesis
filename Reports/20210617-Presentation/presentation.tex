   \begin{block}{Topic Description}
   We want to develop a method to cluster/visualize a high dimensional dataset $\X$, that contains \textit{hierarchical structure}, i.e: where each datapoint $\X_i$ is a probability distribution from which we have an arbitrary amount of samples. These samples can be used to compute the mean, but also other moments of $\X_i$ such as covariance etc.
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
\item Which datasets exist where each datapoint itself is a probability distribution? \item How are they visualized/clustered now, and which metrics on probability distributions can improve clustering? 
\end{itemize}
