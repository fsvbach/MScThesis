In the modern world data is collected on a daily basis 

GB per day

leading to lots of interesting datasets. 

Getting overview of the dataset first thing are visualization techniques.

However when trying to visualize structure

\section{Examples and Motivation}

Recent improvement in data visualization have led to methods like tSNE ...

Thus a complex multidimensional dataset can be embedded onto the 2D plane and give away structure as in Figure

BAWU


\subsection{Embedding Information}

We can also encode other external information into an embedding, for example the average income leading tio Figure 2

\section{Hierarchical Data}

In this thesis efforts are done to anaylse hierarchical data, that is . ... 

We want to cluster or visualize the higher level using samples of the probability distribution as lower level


\subsection{Loosing Information by taking the mean}

In a later used dataset we find that correlation plays an interesting role as well, thus we lose information by collapsing the whole distribution into the mean.
